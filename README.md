# Dice-game
A classic dice-game also known as Pig Game, The game of Pig is a very simple jeopardy dice game in which two players race to reach 100 points. Players take turns to roll a single dice as many times as they wish, adding all roll results to a running total, but losing their gained score for the turn if they roll a 1.

- Used HTML and CSS for creating game panel.
- Used Javascript DOM - manipulation for adding functionality to the game.



### How to play (Instructions) :-
Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":

- If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
- If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their current total and the player's turn continues.
- If a player chooses to "hold", their current total is added to their total score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
  
The first player to score 100 or more points wins.

For example, the first player, Donald, begins a turn with a roll of 5. Donald could hold and score 5 points, but chooses to roll again. Donald rolls a 2, and could hold with a turn total of 7 points, but chooses to roll again. Donald rolls a 1, and must end his turn without scoring. The next player, Alexis, rolls the sequence 4-5-3-5-5, after which she chooses to hold, and adds her turn total of 22 points to her score.
